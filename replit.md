# Overview

This project is a hybrid monorepo containing two applications: **EcoVillage** (an inactive sustainability education game) and **Rural Water Supply MIS**. The primary focus is the **Rural Water Supply MIS**, a Laravel-based Management Information System designed for rural water infrastructure. Its core mission is to enhance operational efficiency, ensure revenue assurance, and improve customer relationship management for water utilities through multi-tenancy, spatial data, and robust security features.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Application Structure

The project uses a monorepo structure with distinct components: `/client` (React frontend), `/server` (Express.js backend for serving React and proxying API), `/api` (Laravel API backend), and `/shared` (shared TypeScript schemas). It utilizes a dual build system: Vite for the frontend and esbuild for the Node.js backend.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Radix UI.
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js), Laravel 11 (PHP 8.2+).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon Database) with Drizzle ORM (Node.js) and Eloquent (Laravel).
- **3D Graphics**: React Three Fiber (for EcoVillage, if reactivated).

## Dual-Server Architecture

The MIS operates with two simultaneous servers:
- **Express server (port 5000)**: Serves the React frontend and proxies `/api/*` requests to Laravel.
- **Laravel API server (port 8001)**: Handles backend logic, database interactions, and spatial queries.

## Database Architecture

- **Dual ORM Strategy**: Drizzle ORM for Node.js and Eloquent ORM for Laravel, both interacting with PostgreSQL.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Implemented in Laravel with `tenant_id` scoping on core tables for data isolation.
- **Spatial Data**: PostGIS support for GeoJSON polygons, points, and centroids.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Express (Game)**: Session-based authentication.
- **Laravel (MIS)**: Laravel Sanctum for API authentication, Spatie Laravel Permission for granular RBAC, two-factor authentication, secure cookie-based sessions, and comprehensive multi-tenancy hardening.

## Security Features (Laravel)

CSRF protection, strict CORS, secure cookie settings, RBAC enforcement for all API endpoints, automatic audit logging for mutation operations, static analysis (PHPStan), and dependency vulnerability scanning.

## API Design

- **Express Backend**: RESTful API with request/response logging, JSON parsing, and error handling.
- **Laravel Backend**: API versioning (`/api/v1`), resource-based controllers, service layer pattern, paginated responses, type-safe API client wrapper, and structured error responses.

## Frontend Architecture

- **Component Design**: Radix UI for accessible components, custom hooks for authentication and abilities.
- **State Management**: Zustand for game state, TanStack Query for server state and caching.
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes and nested layouts.
- **Module Features**: Production-ready CRM, Revenue Assurance, and Hydro-Meteorological modules with comprehensive error handling, loading states, defensive rendering, and MapLibre GL integration for spatial data.
- **Accessibility**: Colorblind-friendly palette, adjustable font sizes, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, WCAG compliance focus.

## Development Workflow

Includes build scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run start`, `npm run db:push`), code quality tools (TypeScript strict mode, PHPStan, Laravel Pint), and `.env` files for environment configuration.
